abstract = {Microorganisms have evolved a complex signature of communication termed quorum sensing (QS), which is based on the exchange and sensing of low molecular- weight signal compounds. The ability to communicate within the microbial population gives the advantage to coordinate a groups behaviour leading to a higher fitness in the environment. The polymorphic fungus Candida albicans is an opportunistic human pathogen able to regulate virulence traits through the production of at least two QS signal molecules: farnesol and tyrosol. The ability to adopt multiple morphotypes and form biofilms on infected surfaces are the most important pathogenic characteristics regulated by QS and are of clinical relevance. In fact, traditional antimicrobial approaches are often ineffective towards these characteristics. Moreover, the intimate association between C. albicans and other pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, increases the complexity of the infection system. This review outlines the current knowledge on fungal QS and fungal-bacterial interactions emphasizing on C. albicans. Further investigations need to concentrate on the molecular mechanisms and the genetic regulation of these phenomena in order to identify putative novel therapeutic options.},

The transcriptional regulator called PqsR binds to the promoter of pqsABCDE in the presence of PQS or HHQ creating a positive feedback-loop. PqsE, encoded in the operon for AQ synthesis, is a crucial protein for pyocyanin production, activating the Rhl system by a still not fully understood mechanism. In turn, the regulation of the PQS system is modulated by Las and Rhl systems, which act positively and negatively, respectively. This review focuses on the PQS system, from its discovery to its role in Pseudomonas pathogenesis, such as iron depletion and pyocyanin synthesis that involves the PqsE protein - an intriguing player of this system.},

Hence, in pathogenic interactions with host organisms, the quorum-sensing (QS) machinery can confer a selective advantage on P. aeruginosa. However, as shown by transcriptomic and proteomic studies, many intracellular metabolic functions are also regulated by quorum sensing. Some of these serve to regenerate the AHL precursors methionine and S-adenosyl-methionine and to degrade adenosine via inosine and hypoxanthine. The fact that a significant percentage of clinical and environmental isolates of P. aeruginosa is defective for QS because of mutation in the major QS regulatory gene lasR, raises the question of whether the QS machinery can have a negative impact on the organism's fitness. In vitro, lasR mutants have a higher probability to escape lytic death in stationary phase under alkaline conditions than has the QS-proficient wild type. Similar selective forces might also operate in natural environments.},

Quorum sensing systems are widespread among pseudomonads and the one of the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa belongs to the most extensively studied cell-to-cell communication systems. In this organism, quorum sensing is highly complex and is made up of two interlinked N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-dependent regulatory circuits, which are further modulated by a non-AHL-related signal molecule and numerous regulators acting both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. This genetic complexity may be one of the key elements responsible for the tremendous environmental versatility of P. aeruginosa. Work of the past few years showed that quorum sensing is essential for the expression of a battery of virulence factors as well as for biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa and thus represents an attractive target for the design of novel drugs for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. Furthermore, the cell-to-cell communication ability was also demonstrated in a number of additional pseudomonads.},

Quorum sensing (QS) allows cell-to-cell communication: sensing the environment, this system coordinates the expression of various genes within the bacterial population. QS is based on an interaction between a small diffusible molecule, an acylhomoserine lactone (AHL), and a transcriptionnal activator. Two QS systems, the las and rhl systems, have been identified in P. aeruginosa. The las system associates the transcriptionnal activator protein LasR and LasI responsible for the synthesis of a specific AHL: C12-HSL. This system was shown to activate the expression of a large number of virulence factors. Similarly, the rhl system associates the transcriptionnal activator protein RhlR with RhlI, which is responsible for the synthesis of another AHL: C4-HSL. Synthesis and secretion of a number of virulence factors are controlled by QS. Utilization of different animals models showed the crucial role of QS in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections. The discovery of QS has given a new opportunity to treat bacterial infection by another means than growth inhibition. New drugs inhibiting QS were recently discovered: furanone compounds can repress a large number of QS-regulated genes, including numerous P. aeruginosa virulence factor genes. Furanone administration to mice infected with P. aeruginosa significantly reduced lung bacterial load compared with the control group.},

Referred to as quorum sensing, cell-to-cell communication mechanisms have been adopted by bacteria in order to co-ordinate their gene expression. By behaving as a community rather than as individuals, bacteria can simultaneously switch on their virulence factor production and establish successful infections in eukaryotes. Understanding pathogen-host interactions requires the use of infection models. As the use of rodents is limited, for ethical considerations and the high costs associated with their use, alternative models based on invertebrates have been developed. Invertebrate models have the benefits of low handling costs, limited space requirements and rapid generation of results. This review presents examples of such models available for studying the pathogenicity of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Quorum sensing interference, known as quorum quenching, suggests a promising disease-control strategy since quorum-quenching mechanisms appear to play important roles in microbe-microbe and host-pathogen interactions.

To do so, bacterial cells synthesize autoinducer (AI) molecules, release them to the environment, and take them up. Thereby, the AI concentration reflects the cell density. When the AI concentration exceeds a critical threshold in the cells, the AI may activate the expression of virulence-associated genes or of luminescent proteins. It has been argued that targeting the QS system puts less selective pressure on these pathogens and should avoid the development of resistant bacteria. Therefore, the molecular components of QS systems have been suggested as promising targets for developing new anti-infective compounds. Here, we review the QS systems of selected gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, namely, Vibrio fischeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, and discuss various antivirulence strategies based on blocking different components of the QS machinery.},

Most QS inhibitors target species-specific signals, such as acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) and oligopeptides. Methodologies for intercepting the cross-species signal, autoinducer-2 (AI-2), have only recently emerged. We review these strategies to prevent the relay of the AI-2 signal amongst pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inhibition mechanisms are categorized based on the target (i.e., enzymes for signal generation, the signal molecule itself, or the various components of the signal transduction process).

However, we now appreciate that bacterial cells are in fact, highly communicative. The generic term `quorum sensing' has been adopted to describe the bacterial cell-to-cell communication mechanisms which co-ordinate gene expression usually, but not always, when the population has reached a high cell density. Quorum sensing depends on the synthesis of small molecules (often referred to as pheromones or autoinducers) that diffuse in and out of bacterial cells. As the bacterial population density increases, so does the synthesis of quorum sensing signal molecules, and consequently, their concentration in the external environment rises. Once a critical threshold concentration has been reached, a target sensor kinase or response regulator is activated (or repressed) so facilitating the expression of quorum sensing-dependent genes. Quorum sensing enables a bacterial population to mount a co-operative response that improves access to nutrients or specific environmental niches, promotes collective defence against other competitor prokaryotes or eukaryotic defence mechanisms and facilitates survival through differentiation into morphological forms better able to combat environmental threats. Quorum sensing also crosses the prokaryotic-eukaryotic boundary since quorum sensing-dependent signalling can be exploited or inactivated by both plants and mammals.},

Coupling the production of virulence factors with cell population density ensures that the mammalian host lacks sufficient time to mount an effective defence against consolidated attack. Such a strategy depends on the ability of an individual bacterial cell to sense other members of the same species and in response, differentially express specific sets of genes. Such cell-cell communication is called  and involves the direct or indirect activation of a response regulator by a small diffusible signal molecule. A number of chemically distinct quorum-sensing signal molecules have been described including the N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) in Gram-negative bacteria and post-translationally modified peptides in Gram-positive bacteria. For example, the human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus employ AHLs and peptides, respectively, to control the expression of multiple virulence genes in concert with cell population density. Apart from their role in signal transduction, certain quorum-sensing signal molecules, notably N-(3-oxododecanoyl)homoserine lactone, possess intrinsic pharmacological and immunomodulatory activities such that they may function as virulence determinants per se. While quorum-sensing signal molecules have been detected in tissues in experimental animal model and human infections, the mutation of genes involved in either quorum-sensing signal generation or signal transduction frequently results in the attenuation of virulence. Thus, interference with quorum sensing represents a promising strategy for the therapeutic or prophylactic control of infection.},

In this chapter, QS systems and their signal molecules for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are introduced. Most interestingly, QS regulates the important bacterial behaviors such as metabolism and pathogenesis. QS-regulated microbial metabolism includes antibiotic synthesis, pollutant biodegradation, and bioenergy production, which are very relevant to human health. QS is also well-known for its involvement in bacterial pathogenesis, such as iin nfections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Novel disease diagnosis strategies and antimicrobial agents have also been developed based on QS regulation on bacterial infections. In addition, to meet the requirements for the detection/quantification of QS signaling molecules for research and application, different biosensors have been constructed, which will also be reviewed here.
