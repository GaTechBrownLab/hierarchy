abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-cell communication system found in many bacterial species, commonly controlling secreted co-operative traits, including extracellular digestive enzymes. We show that the canonical QS regulatory architecture allows bacteria to sense the genotypic composition of high-density populations, and limit co-operative investments to social environments enriched for co-operators. Using high-density populations of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa we map per-capita signal and co-operative enzyme investment in the wild type as a function of the frequency of non-responder cheats. We demonstrate mathematically and experimentally that the observed response rule of `co-operate when surrounded by co-operators' allows bacteria to match their investment in co-operation to the composition of the group, therefore allowing the maintenance of co-operation at lower levels of population structuring (that is, lower relatedness). Similar behavioural responses have been described in vertebrates under the banner of `generalised reciprocity'. Our results suggest that mechanisms of reciprocity are not confined to taxa with advanced cognition, and can be implemented at the cellular level via positive feedback circuits.},

In this study, we used sequence substitutions and insertion mutations in lasBp-lacZ fusion plasmids to explore the role of OP2 in lasB activation.

B. subtilis encodes several Rap proteins and Phr peptides, and the processes regulated by many of these Rap proteins and Phr peptides are unknown. We used DNA microarrays to characterize the roles that several rap-phr signaling modules play in regulating gene expression. We found that rapK-phrK regulates the expression of a number of genes activated by the response regulator ComA. ComA activates expression of genes involved in competence development and the production of several secreted products. Two Phr peptides, PhrC and PhrF, were previously known to stimulate the activity of ComA. We assayed the roles that PhrC, PhrF, and PhrK play in regulating gene expression and found that these three peptides stimulate ComA-dependent gene expression to different levels and are all required for full expression of genes activated by ComA. The involvement of multiple Rap proteins and Phr peptides allows multiple physiological cues to be integrated into a regulatory network that modulates the timing and magnitude of the ComA response.},

Such communication is termed quorum sensing and can regulate pathogenic virulence factor production and antimicrobial resistance. The quorum sensing system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is currently the most intensively researched, because this bacterium is an opportunistic human pathogen annually responsible for the death of thousands of cystic fibrosis sufferers and many other immunocompromised individuals. Quorum sensing inhibitors can attenuate the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa. Here we present the crystal structure of the P. aeruginosa LasR ligand-binding domain bound to its autoinducer 3-oxo-C(12)-acylhomoserine lactone. The structure is a symmetrical dimer, with each monomer exhibiting an alpha-beta-alpha fold similar to the TraR and SdiA quorum sensing proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Escherichia coli. The structure was determined up to 1.8-A resolution and reveals the atomic interactions between LasR and its autoinducer. The monomer structures of LasR, TraR, and SdiA are comparable but display differences in their quaternary organization. Inspection of their binding sites shows some unexpected variations resulting in quite different conformations of their bound autoinducers. We modeled interactions between LasR and various quorum sensing inhibitors, yielding insight into their possible mechanisms of action. The structure also provides a platform for the optimization, or de novo design, of quorum sensing inhibitors.},

However, many proteobacteria have proteins with homology to LuxR receptors yet lack any cognate LuxI-like AHL synthase. Here we show that in the insect pathogen Photorhabdus luminescens the orphan LuxR-type receptor PluR detects endogenously produced α-pyrones that serve as signaling molecules at low nanomolar concentrations. Additionally, the ketosynthase PpyS was identified as pyrone synthase. Reconstitution of the entire system containing PluR, the PluR-target operon we termed pcf and PpyS in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the cell-cell communication circuit is portable.

abstract = {Vibrio cholerae possesses multiple quorum-sensing (QS) systems that control virulence and biofilm formation among other traits. At low cell densities, when QS autoinducers are absent, V. cholerae forms biofilms. At high cell densities, when autoinducers have accumulated, biofilm formation is repressed, and dispersal occurs. Here, we focus on the roles of two well-characterized QS autoinducers that function in parallel. One autoinducer, called cholerae autoinducer-1 (CAI-1), is used to measure Vibrio abundance, and the other autoinducer, called autoinducer-2 (AI-2), is widely produced by different bacterial species and presumed to enable V. cholerae to assess the total bacterial cell density of the vicinal community. The two V. cholerae autoinducers funnel information into a shared signal relay pathway. This feature of the QS system architecture has made it difficult to understand how specific information can be extracted from each autoinducer, how the autoinducers might drive distinct output behaviors, and, in turn, how the bacteria use QS to distinguish kin from nonkin in bacterial communities. We develop a live-cell biofilm formation and dispersal assay that allows examination of the individual and combined roles of the two autoinducers in controlling V. cholerae behavior. We show that the QS system works as a coincidence detector in which both autoinducers must be present simultaneously for repression of biofilm formation to occur. Within that context, the CAI-1 QS pathway is activated when only a few V. cholerae cells are present, whereas the AI-2 pathway is activated only at much higher cell density. The consequence of this asymmetry is that exogenous sources of AI-2, but not CAI-1, contribute to satisfying the coincidence detector to repress biofilm formation and promote dispersal. We propose that V. cholerae uses CAI-1 to verify that some of its kin are present before committing to the high-cell-density QS mode, but it is, in fact, the broadly made autoinducer AI-2 that sets the pace of the V. cholerae QS program. This first report of unique roles for the different V. cholerae autoinducers suggests that detection of kin fosters a distinct outcome from detection of nonkin.},

Mathematical models have been developed to investigate a number of aspects of QS, resulting in a wide range of model structures; many have focused on either the molecular or the population scale. In this paper, I show that many published models fail to satisfy physical constraints (such as conservation of matter) or rely on a priori assumptions that may not be valid. I present new, simple models of canonical Gram-negative and Gram-positive QS systems, in both well-mixed and biofilm populations, focusing on the interaction between molecular and population processes. I show that this interaction may be crucial for several important features of QS, including bistability and the localization of QS in space.

Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a  computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of mortality among immunocompromised patients in clinical setups. The hallmarks of virulence in P. aeruginosa encompass six biologically competent attributes that cumulatively drive disease progression in a multistep manner. These multifaceted hallmarks lay the principal foundation for rationalizing the complexities of pseudomonal infections. They include factors for host colonization and bacterial motility, biofilm formation, production of destructive enzymes, toxic secondary metabolites, iron-chelating siderophores and toxins. This arsenal of virulence hallmarks is fostered and stringently regulated by the bacterial signalling system called quorum sensing (QS). The central regulatory functions of QS in controlling the timely expression of these virulence hallmarks for adaptation and survival drive the disease outcome. This review describes the intricate mechanisms of QS in P. aeruginosa and its role in shaping bacterial responses, boosting bacterial fitness. We summarize the virulence hallmarks of P. aeruginosa, relating them with the QS circuitry in clinical infections. We also examine the role of QS in the development of drug resistance and propose a novel antivirulence therapy to combat P. aeruginosa infections. This can prove to be a next-generation therapy that may eventually become refractory to the use of conventional antimicrobial treatments.},

The qscR gene product governs the timing of quorum-sensing-controlled gene expression and it dampens virulence in an insect model. We present evidence that suggests the primary role of QscR is repression of lasI. A qscR mutant produces the LasI-generated signal prematurely, and this results in premature transcription of a number of quorum-sensing-regulated genes. When fed to Drosophila melanogaster, the qscR mutant kills the animals more rapidly than the parental P. aeruginosa. The repression of lasI by QscR could serve to ensure that quorum-sensing-controlled genes are not activated in environments where they are not useful.},

Although the intracellular regulatory mechanisms of QS are often well-understood, the functional roles of QS remain controversial. In particular, the use of multiple signals by many bacterial species poses a serious challenge to current functional theories. Here, we address this challenge by showing that bacteria can use multiple QS signals to infer both their social (density) and physical (mass-transfer) environment. Analytical and evolutionary simulation models show that the detection of, and response to, complex social/physical contrasts requires multiple signals with distinct half-lives and combinatorial (nonadditive) responses to signal concentrations. We test these predictions using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and demonstrate significant differences in signal decay between its two primary signal molecules, as well as diverse combinatorial responses to dual-signal inputs. QS is associated with the control of secreted factors, and we show that secretome genes are preferentially controlled by synergistic  responses to multiple signal inputs, ensuring the effective expression of secreted factors in high-density and low mass-transfer environments. Our results support a new functional hypothesis for the use of multiple signals and, more generally, show that bacteria are capable of combinatorial communication.},

The ability to adopt multiple morphotypes and form biofilms on infected surfaces are the most important pathogenic characteristics regulated by QS and are of clinical relevance. In fact, traditional antimicrobial approaches are often ineffective towards these characteristics.

The las system is considered to stand at the top of the QS hierarchy. However, some virulence factors such as pyocyanin have been reported to still be produced in lasR mutants under certain conditions. Interestingly, such mutants arise spontaneously under various conditions, including in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients. Using transcriptional lacZ reporters, LC/MS quantification and phenotypic assays, we have investigated the regulation of QS-controlled factors by the las system. Our results show that activity of the rhl system is only delayed in a lasR mutant, thus allowing the expression of multiple virulence determinants such as pyocyanin, rhamnolipids and C(4)-homoserine lactone (HSL) during the late stationary phase. Moreover, at this stage, RhlR is able to overcome the absence of the las system by activating specific LasR-controlled functions, including production of 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL and Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). P. aeruginosa is thus able to circumvent the deficiency of one of its QS systems by allowing the other to take over. This work demonstrates that the QS hierarchy is more complex than the model simply presenting the las system above the rhl system.},

We also show that a solution to the problem of exploitation is kin selection, if interacting bacterial cells tend to be close relatives.

abstract = {In microbial  (QS) communication systems, microbes produce and respond to a signaling molecule, enabling a cooperative response at high cell densities. Many species of bacteria show fast, intraspecific, evolutionary divergence of their QS pathway specificity--signaling molecules activate cognate receptors in the same strain but fail to activate, and sometimes inhibit, those of other strains. Despite many molecular studies, it has remained unclear how a signaling molecule and receptor can coevolve, what maintains diversity, and what drives the evolution of cross-inhibition. Here I use mathematical analysis to show that when QS controls the production of extracellular enzymes----diversification can readily evolve. Coevolution is positively selected by cycles of alternating  receptor mutations and  signaling mutations. The maintenance of diversity and the evolution of cross-inhibition between strains are facilitated by facultative cheating between the competing strains. My results suggest a role for complex social strategies in the long-term evolution of QS systems. More generally, my model of QS divergence suggests a form of kin recognition where different kin types coexist in unstructured populations.},

The production and degradation of AHLs were analysed in different growth phases of the bacterium. Using the analytical tools of ultra performance liquid chromatography and high resolution MS, it was possible to determine not only the various AHLs synthesized over time but also their degradation products. 3-oxo-decanoyl-homoserine lactone was found to be the dominant AHL, which reached its maximum in the early logarithmic growth phase. Although the pH of the medium was neutral, the AHLs were degraded thereafter rapidly to the corresponding homoserines and other metabolites. The proposed lactonase gene of P. putida IsoF could not be identified, because it is apparently quite different from hitherto described lactonases. The analytical data were used to calculate the rates and thresholds of AHL production by mathematical modelling, allowing quantitative predictions and a further understanding of the QS-based regulations in this bacterium. This study, combining microbiological, chemical and mathematical approaches, suggests that AHL degradation is an integral part of the whole autoinducer circuit of P. putida IsoF.},

The transcriptional regulator called PqsR binds to the promoter of pqsABCDE in the presence of PQS or HHQ creating a positive feedback-loop. PqsE, encoded in the operon for AQ synthesis, is a crucial protein for pyocyanin production, activating the Rhl system by a still not fully understood mechanism. In turn, the regulation of the PQS system is modulated by Las and Rhl systems, which act positively and negatively, respectively. This review focuses on the PQS system, from its discovery to its role in Pseudomonas pathogenesis, such as iron depletion and pyocyanin synthesis that involves the PqsE protein - an intriguing player of this system.},

How do specific QS receptors respond to their cognate signals with high fidelity? Why do some receptors maintain low signal recognition specificity? In addition, many QS systems are composed of multiple intersecting signaling pathways: what are the benefits of preserving such a complex signaling network when a simple linear `one-to-one' regulatory pathway seems sufficient to monitor cell density? Here, we will discuss different molecular mechanisms employed by various QS systems that ensure productive and specific QS responses.

Two parallel quorum-sensing systems have been identified in the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi. System 1 consists of the LuxM-dependent autoinducer HAI-1 and the HAI-1 sensor, LuxN. System 2 consists of the LuxS-dependent autoinducer AI-2 and the AI-2 detector, LuxPQ. The related bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, a human pathogen, possesses System 2 (LuxS, AI-2, and LuxPQ) but does not have obvious homologues of V. harveyi System 1. Rather, System 1 of V. cholerae is made up of the CqsA-dependent autoinducer CAI-1 and a sensor called CqsS. Using a V. cholerae CAI-1 reporter strain we show that many other marine bacteria, including V. harveyi, produce CAI-1 activity. Genetic analysis of V. harveyi reveals cqsA and cqsS, and phenotypic analysis of V. harveyi cqsA and cqsS mutants shows that these functions comprise a third V. harveyi quorum-sensing system that acts in parallel to Systems 1 and 2. Together these communication systems act as a three-way coincidence detector in the regulation of a variety of genes, including those responsible for bioluminescence, type III secretion, and metalloprotease production.},

Both autoinducers share one signal transduction pathway to control the production of AphA, a key transcriptional activator of biofilm formation and virulence genes. In this study, we demonstrate that the recently identified autoinducer, DPO, also controls AphA production in V. cholerae. DPO, functioning through the transcription factor VqmA and the VqmR small RNA, reduces AphA levels at the post-transcriptional level and consequently inhibits virulence gene expression. VqmR-mediated repression of AphA provides an important link between the AI-2/CAI-1 and DPO-dependent quorum sensing pathways in V. cholerae. Transcriptome analyses comparing the effect of single autoinducers versus autoinducer combinations show that quorum sensing controls the expression of ∼400 genes in V. cholerae and that all three autoinducers are required for a full quorum sensing response. Together, our data provide a global view on autoinducer interplay in V. cholerae and highlight the importance of RNA-based gene control for collective functions in this major human pathogen.},

However, as shown by transcriptomic and proteomic studies, many intracellular metabolic functions are also regulated by quorum sensing. Some of these serve to regenerate the AHL precursors methionine and S-adenosyl-methionine and to degrade adenosine via inosine and hypoxanthine. The fact that a significant percentage of clinical and environmental isolates of P. aeruginosa is defective for QS because of mutation in the major QS regulatory gene lasR, raises the question of whether the QS machinery can have a negative impact on the organism's fitness. In vitro, lasR mutants have a higher probability to escape lytic death in stationary phase under alkaline conditions than has the QS-proficient wild type. Similar selective forces might also operate in natural environments.},

Quorum sensing systems are widespread among pseudomonads and the one of the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa belongs to the most extensively studied cell-to-cell communication systems. In this organism, quorum sensing is highly complex and is made up of two interlinked N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-dependent regulatory circuits, which are further modulated by a non-AHL-related signal molecule and numerous regulators acting both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. This genetic complexity may be one of the key elements responsible for the tremendous environmental versatility of P. aeruginosa. Work of the past few years showed that quorum sensing is essential for the expression of a battery of virulence factors as well as for biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa and thus represents an attractive target for the design of novel drugs for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections.

We find diverse, intricately shaped input functions, despite the similarity in the regulatory circuitry of these genes. Surprisingly, some of the input functions are nonmonotonic, peaking at intermediate signal levels. Furthermore, most of the input functions show separation of variables, in the sense that they can be described as the product of simple functions that depend on a single input.

abstract = {Quorum sensing is a mechanism of bacterial cell-cell communication that relies on the production and detection of small molecule autoinducers, which facilitate the synchronous expression of genes involved in group behaviors, such as virulence factor production and biofilm formation. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing network consists of multiple interconnected transcriptional regulators, with the transcription factor, RhlR, acting as one of the main drivers of quorum sensing behaviors. RhlR is a LuxR-type transcription factor that regulates its target genes when bound to its cognate autoinducer, C4-homoserine lactone, which is synthesized by RhlI. RhlR function is also regulated by the metallo-β-hydrolase enzyme, PqsE. We recently showed that PqsE binds RhlR to alter its affinity for promoter DNA, a new mechanism of quorum-sensing receptor activation. Here, we perform ChIP-seq analyses of RhlR to map the binding of RhlR across the P. aeruginosa genome, and to determine the impact of C4-homoserine lactone and PqsE on RhlR binding to different sites across the P. aeruginosa genome. We identify 40 RhlR binding sites, all but three of which are associated with genes known to be regulated by RhlR. C4-homoserine lactone is required for maximal binding of RhlR to many of its DNA sites. Moreover, C4-homoserine lactone is required for maximal RhlR-dependent transcription activation from all sites, regardless of whether it impacts RhlR binding to DNA. PqsE is required for maximal binding of RhlR to many DNA sites, with similar effects on RhlR-dependent transcription activation from those sites. However, the effects of PqsE on RhlR specificity are distinct from those of C4-homoserine lactone, and PqsE is sufficient for RhlR binding to some DNA sites in the absence of C4-homoserine lactone. Together, C4-homoserine lactone and PqsE are required for RhlR binding at the large majority of its DNA sites. Thus, our work reveals three distinct modes of activation by RhlR: i) when RhlR is unbound by autoinducer but bound by PqsE, ii) when RhlR is bound by autoinducer but not bound by PqsE, and iii) when RhlR is bound by both autoinducer and PqsE, establishing a stepwise mechanism for the progression of the RhlR-RhlI-PqsE quorum sensing pathway in P. aeruginosa.},

We used a LexA-based protein interaction assay to demonstrate that LasR forms multimers only when 3O-C(12)-HSL is present. A series of LasR molecules containing internal deletions or substitutions in single, conserved amino acid residues indicated that the N-terminal portion of LasR is required for multimerization. Studies performed with these mutant versions of LasR demonstrated that the ability of LasR to multimerize correlates with its ability to function as a transcriptional activator of lasI, a gene known to be tightly regulated by the LasR-3O-C(12)-HSL regulatory system. A LasR molecule that carries a C-terminal deletion can function as a dominant-negative mutant in P. aeruginosa, as shown by its ability to decrease expression of lasB, another LasR-3O-C(12)-HSL target gene.

abstract = {The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa activates expression of many virulence genes in a cell density-dependent manner by using an intricate quorum-sensing (QS) network. QS in P. aeruginosa involves two acyl-homoserine-lactone circuits, LasI-LasR and RhlI-RhlR. LasI-LasR is required to activate many genes including those coding for RhlI-RhlR. P. aeruginosa causes chronic infections in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). In these infections, LasR mutants are common, but rhlR-rhlI expression has escaped LasR regulation in many CF isolates. To better understand the evolutionary trajectory of P. aeruginosa QS in chronic infections, we grew LasR mutants of the well-studied P. aeruginosa strain, PAO1, in conditions that recapitulate an environment where QS signal synthesis by other bacteria might still occur. When QS is required for growth, addition of the RhlI product butyryl-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), or bacteria that produce C4-HSL, to LasR mutants results in the rapid emergence of a population with a LasR-independent RhlI-RhlR QS system. These evolved populations exhibit subsequent growth without added C4-HSL. The variants that emerge have mutations in mexT, which codes for a transcription factor that controls expression of multiple genes. LasR-MexT mutants have a competitive advantage over both the parent LasR mutant and a LasR-MexT-RhlR mutant. Our findings suggest a plausible evolutionary trajectory for QS in P. aeruginosa CF infections where LasR mutants arise during infection, but because these mutants are surrounded by C4-HSL-producing P. aeruginosa, variants rewired to have a LasR-independent RhlIR system quickly emerge.},

Two quorum-sensing regulons have been identified in which the LuxR homologues LasR and RhlR are activated by N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL) respectively. The lasR and rhlR genes are linked to the luxl homologues lasl and rhll, which are responsible for synthesis of OdDHL and BHL, respectively. As lasRl and rhlRl are both involved in regulating synthesis of exoenzymes such as elastase, we sought to determine the nature of their interrelationship. By using lacZ transcriptional fusions in both homologous (P. aeruginosa) and heterologous (Escherichia coli) genetic backgrounds we provide evidence that (i) lasR is expressed constitutively throughout the growth cycle, (ii) rhlR expression is regulated by LasR/OdDHL, and (iii) that RhlR/BHL regulates rhll. We also show that expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor gene rpoS is abolished in a P. aeruginosa lasR mutant and in the pleiotropic BHL-negative mutant PANO67. Furthermore, our data reveal that kin E. coli, an rpoS-lacZ fusion is regulated directly by RhlR/BHL. Taken together, these results indicate that P. aeruginosa employs a multilayered hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving RhlR/BHL and LasR/OdDHL, interlinked via RpoS, to integrate the regulation of virulence determinants and secondary metabolites with adaptation and survival in the stationary phase.},

Quorum sensing (QS) allows cell-to-cell communication: sensing the environment, this system coordinates the expression of various genes within the bacterial population. QS is based on an interaction between a small diffusible molecule, an acylhomoserine lactone (AHL), and a transcriptionnal activator. Two QS systems, the las and rhl systems, have been identified in P. aeruginosa. The las system associates the transcriptionnal activator protein LasR and LasI responsible for the synthesis of a specific AHL: C12-HSL. This system was shown to activate the expression of a large number of virulence factors. Similarly, the rhl system associates the transcriptionnal activator protein RhlR with RhlI, which is responsible for the synthesis of another AHL: C4-HSL. Synthesis and secretion of a number of virulence factors are controlled by QS. Utilization of different animals models showed the crucial role of QS in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections. The discovery of QS has given a new opportunity to treat bacterial infection by another means than growth inhibition. New drugs inhibiting QS were recently discovered: furanone compounds can repress a large number of QS-regulated genes, including numerous P. aeruginosa virulence factor genes. Furanone administration to mice infected with P. aeruginosa significantly reduced lung bacterial load compared with the control group.},

Quorum sensing (QS), a cell density-based intercellular communication system, which plays a key role in regulation of the bacterial virulence and biofilm formation, could be a promising target for developing new strategies against P. aeruginosa infection. The QS network of P. aeruginosa is organized in a multi-layered hierarchy consisting of at least four interconnected signaling mechanisms. Evidence is accumulating that the QS regulatory network not only responds to bacterial population changes but also could react to environmental stress cues.

Using single-cell fluorescence microscopy, we quantified the signaling responses to and analyzed the integration of multiple autoinducers by the model quorum-sensing bacterium Vibrio harveyi. Our results revealed that signals from two distinct autoinducers, AI-1 and AI-2, are combined strictly additively in a shared phosphorelay pathway, with each autoinducer contributing nearly equally to the total response. We found a coherent response across the population with little cell-to-cell variation, indicating that the entire population of cells can reliably distinguish several distinct conditions of external autoinducer concentration. We speculate that the use of multiple autoinducers allows a growing population of cells to synchronize gene expression during a series of distinct developmental stages.},

Therefore, a more thorough understanding of its virulence control mechanisms is essential for the development of new anti-pathogenic strategies. Numerous bacteria rely on a cell density-dependent communication system known as quorum sensing (QS) to regulate several bacterial functions, including the expression of virulence factors. The QS systems described for E. coli include the orphan SdiA regulator, an autoinducer-2 (AI-2), an autoinducer-3 (AI-3) system, and indole, which allow E. coli to establish different communication processes to sense and respond to the surrounding environment. This review aims to summarise the current knowledge of the global QS network in E. coli and its influence on virulence and pathogenesis. This understanding will help to improve anti-virulence strategies with the E. coli QS network in focus.},

A third P. aeruginosa signal, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone [Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS)], also plays a significant role in the transcription of multiple P. aeruginosa virulence genes. PQS is intertwined in the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing hierarchy with its production and bioactivity requiring the las and rhl quorum sensing systems, respectively. This report presents a preliminary transcriptional analysis of pqsA, the first gene of the recently discovered PQS biosynthetic gene cluster. We show that pqsA transcription required pqsR, a transcriptional activator protein encoded within the PQS biosynthetic gene cluster. It was also found that the transcription of pqsA and subsequent production of PQS was induced by the las quorum sensing system and repressed by the rhl quorum sensing system. In addition, PQS production was dependent on the ratio of 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL to C(4)-HSL, suggesting a regulatory balance between quorum sensing systems. These data are an important early step toward understanding the regulation of PQS synthesis and the role of PQS in P. aeruginosa intercellular signaling.},

Our results suggest that the need to limit interference between input signals places strong constraints on the architecture of bacterial signal-integration networks, and that bacteria probably have evolved active strategies for minimizing this interference.

QS systems are tremendously diverse in terms of their specific sensory components, the biochemical and transport properties of signaling molecules, their target functions and the context in which QS-mediated functions are activated. Cutting across this diversity, however, the central architecture of QS systems is universal; it comprises signal synthesis, secretion, degradation and detection. We are thus able to derive a general metric for QS `sensing potential' based on this `core' module. The sensing potential quantifies the ability of a single bacterium to sense the dimensions of its microenvironment. This simple metric captures the dominant activation properties of diverse QS systems, giving a concise description of the sensing characteristics. As such, it provides a convenient quantitative framework to study the phenotypic effects of QS characteristics. As an example, we show how QS characteristics uniquely determine the scenarios in which regulation of a typical QS-controlled function, such as exoenzyme secretion, becomes advantageous.},

Understanding pathogen-host interactions requires the use of infection models. As the use of rodents is limited, for ethical considerations and the high costs associated with their use, alternative models based on invertebrates have been developed. Invertebrate models have the benefits of low handling costs, limited space requirements and rapid generation of results. This review presents examples of such models available for studying the pathogenicity of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Quorum sensing interference, known as quorum quenching, suggests a promising disease-control strategy since quorum-quenching mechanisms appear to play important roles in microbe-microbe and host-pathogen interactions.

The las system consists of a transcriptional activator, LasR, and LasI, which directs the synthesis of the autoinducer N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (PAI-1). Induction of lasB (encoding elastase) and other virulence genes requires LasR and PAI-1. The rhl system consists of a putative transcriptional activator, RhlR, and RhlI, which directs the synthesis of N-butyryl homoserine lactone (PAI-2). Rhamnolipid production in P. aeruginosa has been reported to require both the rhl system and rhlAB (encoding a rhamnosyltransferase). Here we report the generation of a delta lasI mutant and both delta lasI delta rhlI and delta lasR rhlR::Tn501 double mutants of strain PAO1. Rhamnolipid production and elastolysis were reduced in the delta lasI single mutant and abolished in the double-mutant strains. rhlAB mRNA was not detected in these strains at mid-logarithmic phase but was abundant in the parental strain. Further RNA analysis of the wild-type strain revealed that rhlAB is organized as an operon. The rhlAB transcriptional start was mapped, and putative sigma 54 and sigma 70 promoters were identified upstream. To define components required for rhlAB expression, we developed a bioassay in Escherichia coli and demonstrated that PAI-2 and RhlR are required and sufficient for expression of rhlA. To characterize the putative interaction between PAI-2 and RhlR, we demonstrated that [3H]PAI-2 binds to E. coli cells expressing RhlR and not to those expressing LasR. Finally, the specificity of the las and rhl systems was examined in E. coli bioassays. The las system was capable of mildly activating rhlA, and similarly, the rhl system partly activated lasB. However; these effects were much less than the activation of rhlA by the rhl system and lasB by the las system. The results presented here further characterize the roles of the rhl and las quorum-sensing systems in virulence gene expression.},

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cell-to-cell signaling controls expression of extracellular virulence factors, the type II secretion apparatus, a stationary-phase sigma factor (sigmas), and biofilm differentiation. The fact that a similar signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone, freely diffuses through Vibrio fischeri and Escherichia coli cells has led to the assumption that all AIs are freely diffusible. In this work, transport of the two P. aeruginosa AIs, N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) (formerly called PAI-1) and N-butyryl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) (formerly called PAI-2), was studied by using tritium-labeled signals. When [3H]C4-HSL was added to cell suspensions of P. aeruginosa, the cellular concentration reached a steady state in less than 30 s and was nearly equal to the external concentration, as expected for a freely diffusible compound. In contrast, [3H]3OC12-HSL required about 5 min to reach a steady state, and the cellular concentration was 3 times higher than the external level. Addition of inhibitors of the cytoplasmic membrane proton gradient, such as azide, led to a strong increase in cellular accumulation of [3H]3OC12-HSL, suggesting the involvement of active efflux. A defined mutant lacking the mexA-mexB-oprM-encoded active-efflux pump accumulated [3H]3OC12-HSL to levels similar to those in the azide-treated wild-type cells. Efflux experiments confirmed these observations. Our results show that in contrast to the case for C4-HSL, P. aeruginosa cells are not freely permeable to 3OC12-HSL. Instead, the mexA-mexB-oprM-encoded efflux pump is involved in active efflux of 3OC12-HSL. Apparently the length and/or degree of substitution of the N-acyl side chain determines whether an AI is freely diffusible or is subject to active efflux by P. aeruginosa.},

abstract = {Mathematical models to study quorum sensing (QS) have become an important tool to explore all aspects of this type of bacterial communication. A wide spectrum of mathematical tools and methods such as dynamical systems, stochastics, and spatial models can be employed. In this chapter, we focus on giving an overview of models consisting of differential equations (DE), which can be used to describe changing quantities, for example, the dynamics of one or more signaling molecule in time and space, often in conjunction with bacterial growth dynamics. The chapter is divided into two sections: ordinary differential equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE) models of QS. Rates of change are represented mathematically by derivatives, i.e., in terms of DE. ODE models allow describing changes in one independent variable, for example, time. PDE models can be used to follow changes in more than one independent variable, for example, time and space. Both types of models often consist of systems (i.e., more than one equation) of equations, such as equations for bacterial growth and autoinducer concentration dynamics. Almost from the onset, mathematical modeling of QS using differential equations has been an interdisciplinary endeavor and many of the works we revised here will be placed into their biological context.},

journal = {BMC Syst Biol}, 
volume = {5}, 
pages = {153}, 
year = {2011}, 
abstract = {BACKGROUND:  One of the puzzles in bacterial quorum sensing is understanding how an organism integrates the information gained from multiple input signals. The marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri regulates its bioluminescence through a quorum sensing mechanism that receives input from three pheromone signals, including two acyl homoserine lactone (HSL) signals. While the role of the 3-oxo-C6 homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL) signal in activating the lux genes has been extensively studied and modeled, the role of the C8 homoserine lactone (C8HSL) is less obvious, as it can either activate luminescence or block its activation. It remains unclear how crosstalk between C8HSL and 3OC6HSL affects the information that the bacterium obtains through quorum sensing. RESULTS:  We have used microfluidic methods to measure the response of individual V.fischeri cells to combinations of C8HSL and 3OC6HSL. By measuring the fluorescence of individual V.fischeri cells containing a chromosomal gfp-reporter for the lux genes, we study how combinations of exogenous HSLs affect both the population average and the cell-to-cell variability of lux activation levels. At the level of a population average, the crosstalk between the C8HSL and 3OC6HSL inputs is well-described by a competitive inhibition model. At the level of individual cells, the heterogeneity in the lux response depends only on the average degree of activation, so that the noise in the output is not reduced by the presence of the second HSL signal. Overall we find that the mutual information between the signal inputs and the lux output is less than one bit. A nonlinear correlation between fluorescence and bioluminescence outputs from lux leads to different noise properties for these reporters. CONCLUSIONS:  The lux genes in V.fischeri do not appear to distinguish between the two HSL inputs, and even with two signal inputs the regulation of lux is extremely noisy. Hence the role of crosstalk from the C8HSL input may not be to improve sensing precision, but rather to suppress the sensitivity of the switch for as long as possible during colony growth.},

In Gram-negative bacteria, quorum sensing systems function through a cell-to-cell signal molecule (autoinducer) that consists of a homoserine lactone with a fatty acid side chain. Such is the case in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which contains two quorum sensing systems (las and rhl) that operate via the autoinducers, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone. The study of these signal molecules has shown that they bind to and activate transcriptional activator proteins that specifically induce numerous P. aeruginosa virulence genes. We report here that P. aeruginosa produces another signal molecule, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone, which has been designated as the Pseudomonas quinolone signal. It was found that this unique cell-to-cell signal controlled the expression of lasB, which encodes for the major virulence factor, LasB elastase. We also show that the synthesis and bioactivity of Pseudomonas quinolone signal were mediated by the P. aeruginosa las and rhl quorum sensing systems, respectively. The demonstration that 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone can function as an intercellular signal sheds light on the role of secondary metabolites and shows that P. aeruginosa cell-to-cell signaling is not restricted to acyl-homoserine lactones.},

Similarly, the rhl system consists of the transcriptional activator protein RhlR and of RhlI, which directs synthesis of the autoinducer PAI-2 (formerly referred to as factor 2). To study the interrelation between the two P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing systems, we fused a lacZ reporter gene to lasR, rhlR, and rhlA and monitored expression of these three genes under various conditions. Our data indicate that lasR and rhlR are expressed in a growth-dependent manner, with activation of each gene occurring during the last half of log-phase growth. We also show that the las quorum-sensing system controls the rhl quorum-sensing system in two ways. First, we found that LasR and PAI-1 activated rhlR transcription. Second, we showed that PAI-1 blocked PAI-2 from binding to RhlR, thereby inhibiting the expression of rhlA. Our data thus indicate that the las system exerts two levels of control on RhlR, transcriptional and posttranslational.},

Some environmental cues provide direct and reliable information (such as nutrient concentrations) and can be responded to individually. Other environmental parameters are harder to infer and require a collective mechanism of sensing. In addition, some environmental challenges are best faced by a group of cells rather than an individual. In this review, we discuss how bacteria sense and overcome environmental challenges as a group using collective mechanisms of sensing, known as `quorum sensing' (QS). QS is characterized by the release and detection of small molecules, potentially allowing individuals to infer environmental parameters such as density and mass transfer. While a great deal of the molecular mechanisms of QS have been described, there is still controversy over its functional role. We discuss what QS senses and how, what it controls and why, and how social dilemmas shape its evolution. Finally, there is a growing focus on the use of QS inhibitors as antibacterial chemotherapy. We discuss the claim that such a strategy could overcome the evolution of resistance. By linking existing theoretical approaches to data, we hope this review will spur greater collaboration between experimental and theoretical researchers.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-cell communication that connects gene expression to environmental conditions (e.g., cell density) in many bacterial species, mediated by diffusible signal molecules. Current functional studies focus on qualitatively distinct QS ON/OFF states. In the context of density sensing, this view led to the adoption of a  analogy in which populations sense when they are above a sufficient density (i.e., ) to efficiently turn on cooperative behaviors. This framework overlooks the potential for intermediate, graded responses to shifts in the environment. In this study, we tracked QS-regulated protease (lasB) expression and showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can deliver a graded behavioral response to fine-scale variation in population density, on both the population and single-cell scales. On the population scale, we saw a graded response to variation in population density (controlled by culture carrying capacity). On the single-cell scale, we saw significant bimodality at higher densities, with separate OFF and ON subpopulations that responded differentially to changes in density: a static OFF population of cells and increasing intensity of expression among the ON population of cells. Together, these results indicate that QS can tune gene expression to graded environmental change, with no critical cell mass or  at which behavioral responses are activated on either the individual-cell or population scale. In an infection context, our results indicate there is not a hard threshold separating a quorate  mode from a subquorate  mode. IMPORTANCE Bacteria can be highly social, controlling collective behaviors via cell-cell communication mechanisms known as quorum sensing (QS). QS is now a large research field, yet a basic question remains unanswered: what is the environmental resolution of QS? The notion of a threshold, or  separating coordinated ON and OFF states is a central dogma in QS, but recent studies have shown heterogeneous responses at a single cell scale. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we showed that populations generate graded responses to environmental variation through shifts in the proportion of cells responding and the intensity of responses. In an infection context, our results indicate that there is not a hard threshold separating a quorate  mode and a subquorate  mode.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a widespread mechanism of environment sensing and behavioural coordination in bacteria. At its core, QS is based on the production, sensing and response to small signalling molecules. Previous work with Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows that QS can be used to achieve quantitative resolution and deliver a dosed response to the bacteria's density environment, implying a sophisticated mechanism of control. To shed light on how the mechanistic signal components contribute to graded responses to density, we assess the impact of genetic (AHL signal synthase deletion) and/or signal supplementation (exogenous AHL addition) perturbations on lasB reaction-norms to changes in density. Our approach condenses data from 2000 timeseries (over 74 000 individual observations) into a comprehensive view of QS-controlled gene expression across variation in genetic, environmental and signal determinants of lasB expression. We first confirm that deleting either (∆lasI, ∆rhlI) or both (∆lasIrhlI) AHL signal synthase gene attenuates QS response to density. In the ∆rhlI background we show persistent yet attenuated density-dependent lasB expression due to native 3-oxo-C12-HSL signalling. We then test if density-independent quantities of AHL signal (3-oxo-C12-HSL, C4-HSL) added to the WT either flatten or increase responsiveness to density and find that the WT response is robust to all tested concentrations of signal, alone or in combination. We then move to progressively supplementing the genetic knockouts and find that cognate signal supplementation of a single AHL signal (∆lasI +3-oxo-C12-HSL, ∆rhlI +C4HSL) is sufficient to restore the ability to respond in a density-dependent manner to increasing density. We also find that dual signal supplementation of the double AHL synthase knockout restores the ability to produce a graded response to increasing density, despite adding a density-independent amount of signal. Only the addition of high concentrations of both AHLs and PQS can force maximal lasB expression and ablate responsiveness to density. Our results show that density-dependent control of lasB expression is robust to multiple combinations of QS gene deletion and density-independent signal supplementation. Our work develops a modular approach to query the robustness and mechanistic bases of the central environmental sensing phenotype of quorum sensing.},

When the AI concentration exceeds a critical threshold in the cells, the AI may activate the expression of virulence-associated genes or of luminescent proteins. It has been argued that targeting the QS system puts less selective pressure on these pathogens and should avoid the development of resistant bacteria. Therefore, the molecular components of QS systems have been suggested as promising targets for developing new anti-infective compounds.

A quadruple complex containing TATA binding protein (TBP), TAFII250, TAFII110, and TAFII60 mediated transcriptional synergism by BCD and HB, whereas triple TBP-TAFII complexes lacking one or the other target coactivator failed to support synergistic activation. Deoxyribonuclease I footprint protection experiments revealed that an integral step leading to transcriptional synergism involves the recruitment of TBP-TAFII complexes to the promoter by way of multivalent contacts between activators and selected TAFIIs.

year = {2007}, 
abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Quorum-sensing regulation of gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is complex. Two interconnected acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) signal-receptor pairs, 3-oxo-dodecanoyl-HSL-LasR and butanoyl-HSL-RhlR, regulate more than 300 genes. The induction of most of the genes is delayed during growth of P. aeruginosa in complex medium, cannot be advanced by addition of exogenous signal, and requires additional regulatory components. Many of these late genes can be induced by addition of signals early by using specific media conditions. While several factors super-regulate the quorum receptors, others may co-regulate target promoters or may affect expression posttranscriptionally. RESULTS:  To better understand the contributions of super-regulation and co-regulation to quorum-sensing gene expression, and to better understand the general structure of the quorum sensing network, we ectopically expressed the two receptors (in the presence of their cognate signals) and another component that affects quorum sensing, the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS, early in growth. We determined the effect on target gene expression by microarray and real-time PCR analysis. Our results show that many target genes (e.g. lasB and hcnABC) are directly responsive to receptor protein levels. Most genes (e.g. lasA, lecA, and phnAB), however, are not significantly affected, although at least some of these genes are directly regulated by quorum sensing. The majority of promoters advanced by RhlR appeared to be regulated directly, which allowed us to build a RhlR consensus sequence. CONCLUSION:  The direct responsiveness of many quorum sensing target genes to receptor protein levels early in growth confirms the role of super-regulation in quorum sensing gene expression. The observation that the induction of most target genes is not affected by signal or receptor protein levels indicates that either target promoters are co-regulated by other transcription factors, or that expression is controlled posttranscriptionally. This architecture permits the integration of multiple signaling pathways resulting in quorum responses that require a  but are otherwise highly adaptable and receptive to environmental conditions.},

Signaling via acyl-homoserine lactones is the paradigm for QS in Proteobacteria and is particularly well understood in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Despite thirty years of mechanistic research, empirical studies have only recently addressed the benefits of QS and provided support for the traditional assumptions regarding its social nature and its role in optimizing cell-density-dependent group behaviors. QS-controlled public-goods production has served to investigate principles that explain the evolution and stability of cooperation, including kin selection, pleiotropic constraints, and metabolic prudence. With respect to medical application, appreciating social dynamics is pertinent to understanding the efficacy of QS-inhibiting drugs and the evolution of resistance. Future work will provide additional insight into the foundational assumptions of QS and relate laboratory discoveries to natural ecosystems.},

Here, we report that these costs vary dramatically in different contexts and have opposing effects on the selection for non-cooperating cheaters. We investigate a prominent example of bacterial cooperation, the secretion of the peptide siderophore pyoverdine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, under different nutrient-limiting conditions. Using metabolic modeling, we show that pyoverdine incurs a fitness cost only when its building blocks carbon or nitrogen are growth-limiting and are diverted from cellular biomass production. We confirm this result experimentally with a continuous-culture approach. We show that pyoverdine non-producers (cheaters) enjoy a large fitness advantage in co-culture with producers (cooperators) and spread to high frequency when limited by carbon, but not when limited by phosphorus. The principle of nutrient-dependent fitness costs has implications for the stability of cooperation in pathogenic and non-pathogenic environments, in biotechnological applications, and beyond the microbial realm.Cooperative behaviour among individuals provides a collective benefit, but is considered costly. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model system, the authors show that secretion of the siderophore pyoverdine only incurs a fitness cost and favours cheating when its building blocks carbon or nitrogen are growth-limiting.},

However, the role of multiple binding sites for the same TFs and their specific spatial arrangement in determining the overall competency of the enhancer has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized the MS2-MCP live imaging technique to quantitatively analyze the regulatory logic of the snail distal enhancer in early Drosophila embryos. Through systematic modulation of Dorsal and Twist binding motifs in this enhancer, we found that a mutation in any one of these binding sites causes a drastic reduction in transcriptional amplitude, resulting in a reduction in mRNA production of the target gene. We provide evidence of synergy, such that multiple binding sites with moderate affinities cooperatively recruit more TFs to drive stronger transcriptional activity than a single site. Moreover, a Hidden Markov-based stochastic model of transcription reveals that embryos with mutated binding sites have a higher probability of returning to the inactive promoter state. We propose that TF-DNA binding regulates spatial and temporal gene expression and drives robust pattern formation by modulating transcriptional kinetics and tuning bursting rates.},

We quantitatively investigated the signaling input-output relation both in cells with all feedback loops present as well as in mutants with specific feedback loops disrupted.

Each of these systems is comprised of a pro-peptide that is secreted to the growth medium and processed to generate a mature short peptide. Each peptide has a cognate intracellular receptor of the RRNPP family, and we show that external addition of P. polymyxa communication peptides leads to reprogramming of the transcriptional response.

Communication is accomplished through production and detection of small molecules in the extracellular milieu. In many bacteria, particularly Vibrio species, multiple QS systems result in multiple signals, as well as cross talk between systems. In this study, we identify two QS systems in the halophilic enteric pathogen Vibrio fluvialis: one acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) based and one CAI-1/AI-2 based. We show that a LuxI homolog, VfqI, primarily produces 3-oxo-C10-HSL, which is sensed by a LuxR homolog, VfqR. VfqR-AHL is required to activate vfqI expression and autorepress vfqR expression. In addition, we have shown that similar to that in V. cholerae and V. harveyi, V. fluvialis produces CAI-1 and AI-2 signal molecules to activate the expression of a V. cholerae HapR homolog through LuxO. Although VfqR-AHL does not regulate hapR expression, HapR can repress vfqR transcription. Furthermore, we found that QS in V. fluvialis positively regulates production of two potential virulence factors, an extracellular protease and hemolysin. QS also affects cytotoxic activity against epithelial tissue cultures. These data suggest that V. fluvialis integrates QS regulatory pathways to play important physiological roles in pathogenesis.},

The process of quorum sensing is regulated by the production and monitoring of certain molecules (referred to as QSMs); on reaching an apparent threshold concentration of QSMs (reflecting high bacterial density) the bacterial colony in concert `switches on' the density-dependent trait. In this paper a mathematical model which describes bacterial population growth and quorum sensing in a well mixed system is proposed and studied. We view the population of bacteria as consisting of down-regulated and up-regulated sub-populations, with QSMs being produced at a much faster rate by the up-regulated cells. Using curve fitting techniques for parameter estimation, solutions of the resulting system of ordinary differential equations are shown to agree well with experimental data. Asymptotic analysis in a biologically relevant limit is used to investigate the timescales for up-regulation of an exponentially growing population of bacteria, revealing the existence of bifurcation between limited and near-total up-regulation. For a fixed population of cells steady-state analysis reveals that in general one physical steady-state solution exists and is linearly stable; we believe this solution to be a global attractor. A bifurcation between limited and near-total up-regulation is also discussed in the steady-state limit.},

Escherichia coli pAHL-BAC cultures produced LasI-synthesized acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) at levels and with kinetics similar to what is observed in cultures of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. Analysis of the lasI transcript also showed similar induction profiles in both the E. coli pAHL-BAC strain and P. aeruginosa. Transposon mutagenesis of pAHL-BAC confirmed that transcriptional regulation by LasR is necessary for 3OC12HSL production, and showed that artificially increasing lasI transcript levels leads to higher levels of 3OC12HSL. Previous studies have shown that P. aeruginosa 3OC12HSL inhibits hypha formation, but not growth, in Candida albicans, and the E. coli pAHL-BAC similarly inhibited filamentation when grown in coculture with the fungus. It is proposed that this system will be useful for the study of factors that impact lasI regulation and 3OC12HSL production, and for the examination of the role of LasI-produced AHLs in bacterial interactions with other organisms.},

As in higher organisms, the information supplied by these molecules is critical for synchronizing the activities of large groups of cells.

This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacteria to monitor the environment for other bacteria and to alter behavior on a population-wide scale in response to changes in the number and/or species present in a community. Most quorum-sensing-controlled processes are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium acting alone but become beneficial when carried out simultaneously by a large number of cells. Thus, quorum sensing confuses the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes because it enables bacteria to act as multicellular organisms. This review focuses on the architectures of bacterial chemical communication networks; how chemical information is integrated, processed, and transduced to control gene expression; how intra- and interspecies cell-cell communication is accomplished; and the intriguing possibility of prokaryote-eukaryote cross-communication.},

However, we now appreciate that bacterial cells are in fact, highly communicative. The generic term `quorum sensing' has been adopted to describe the bacterial cell-to-cell communication mechanisms which co-ordinate gene expression usually, but not always, when the population has reached a high cell density. Quorum sensing depends on the synthesis of small molecules (often referred to as pheromones or autoinducers) that diffuse in and out of bacterial cells. As the bacterial population density increases, so does the synthesis of quorum sensing signal molecules, and consequently, their concentration in the external environment rises. Once a critical threshold concentration has been reached, a target sensor kinase or response regulator is activated (or repressed) so facilitating the expression of quorum sensing-dependent genes. Quorum sensing enables a bacterial population to mount a co-operative response that improves access to nutrients or specific environmental niches, promotes collective defence against other competitor prokaryotes or eukaryotic defence mechanisms and facilitates survival through differentiation into morphological forms better able to combat environmental threats. Quorum sensing also crosses the prokaryotic-eukaryotic boundary since quorum sensing-dependent signalling can be exploited or inactivated by both plants and mammals.},

abstract = {For many pathogens, the outcome of the interaction between host and bacterium is strongly affected by the bacterial population size. Coupling the production of virulence factors with cell population density ensures that the mammalian host lacks sufficient time to mount an effective defence against consolidated attack. Such a strategy depends on the ability of an individual bacterial cell to sense other members of the same species and in response, differentially express specific sets of genes. Such cell-cell communication is called  and involves the direct or indirect activation of a response regulator by a small diffusible signal molecule. A number of chemically distinct quorum-sensing signal molecules have been described including the N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) in Gram-negative bacteria and post-translationally modified peptides in Gram-positive bacteria. For example, the human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus employ AHLs and peptides, respectively, to control the expression of multiple virulence genes in concert with cell population density. Apart from their role in signal transduction, certain quorum-sensing signal molecules, notably N-(3-oxododecanoyl)homoserine lactone, possess intrinsic pharmacological and immunomodulatory activities such that they may function as virulence determinants per se. While quorum-sensing signal molecules have been detected in tissues in experimental animal model and human infections, the mutation of genes involved in either quorum-sensing signal generation or signal transduction frequently results in the attenuation of virulence. Thus, interference with quorum sensing represents a promising strategy for the therapeutic or prophylactic control of infection.},

This so-called quorum sensing (QS) regulation enables bacteria to live in a `society' with cell-cell communication and controls many important bacterial behaviors. In this chapter, QS systems and their signal molecules for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are introduced. Most interestingly, QS regulates the important bacterial behaviors such as metabolism and pathogenesis. QS-regulated microbial metabolism includes antibiotic synthesis, pollutant biodegradation, and bioenergy production, which are very relevant to human health. QS is also well-known for its involvement in bacterial pathogenesis, such as iin nfections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Novel disease diagnosis strategies and antimicrobial agents have also been developed based on QS regulation on bacterial infections. In addition, to meet the requirements for the detection/quantification of QS signaling molecules for research and application, different biosensors have been constructed, which will also be reviewed here. QS regulation is essential to bacterial survival and important to human health.
