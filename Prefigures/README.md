This folder contains the raw figures generated by scripts and applications. Often those figures require manual adjustments in scaling, fonts, etc. to prepare them for publication. In general, the workflow is opening the raw figure in Serifâ€™s Affinity Designer 2 (currently version 2.0.4) and exporting as SVG. Raw PDF files may also require deletion of the background rectangle that defines the page size.
