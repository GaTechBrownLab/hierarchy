abstract = {Many Gram-negative bacteria communicate via molecules called autoinducers to coordinate the activities of their populations. Such communication is termed quorum sensing and can regulate pathogenic virulence factor production and antimicrobial resistance. The quorum sensing system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is currently the most intensively researched, because this bacterium is an opportunistic human pathogen annually responsible for the death of thousands of cystic fibrosis sufferers and many other immunocompromised individuals. Quorum sensing inhibitors can attenuate the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa. Here we present the crystal structure of the P. aeruginosa LasR ligand-binding domain bound to its autoinducer 3-oxo-C(12)-acylhomoserine lactone. The structure is a symmetrical dimer, with each monomer exhibiting an alpha-beta-alpha fold similar to the TraR and SdiA quorum sensing proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Escherichia coli. The structure was determined up to 1.8-A resolution and reveals the atomic interactions between LasR and its autoinducer. The monomer structures of LasR, TraR, and SdiA are comparable but display differences in their quaternary organization. Inspection of their binding sites shows some unexpected variations resulting in quite different conformations of their bound autoinducers. We modeled interactions between LasR and various quorum sensing inhibitors, yielding insight into their possible mechanisms of action. The structure also provides a platform for the optimization, or de novo design, of quorum sensing inhibitors.},

abstract = {Bacteria communicate via small diffusible molecules and thereby mediate group-coordinated behavior, a process referred to as quorum sensing. The prototypical quorum sensing system found in Gram-negative bacteria consists of a LuxI-type autoinducer synthase that produces N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) as signals and a LuxR-type receptor that detects the AHLs to control expression of specific genes. However, many proteobacteria have proteins with homology to LuxR receptors yet lack any cognate LuxI-like AHL synthase. Here we show that in the insect pathogen Photorhabdus luminescens the orphan LuxR-type receptor PluR detects endogenously produced α-pyrones that serve as signaling molecules at low nanomolar concentrations. Additionally, the ketosynthase PpyS was identified as pyrone synthase. Reconstitution of the entire system containing PluR, the PluR-target operon we termed pcf and PpyS in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the cell-cell communication circuit is portable. Our research thus deorphanizes a signaling system and suggests that additional modes of bacterial communication may await discovery.},

Mathematical models have been developed to investigate a number of aspects of QS, resulting in a wide range of model structures; many have focused on either the molecular or the population scale. In this paper, I show that many published models fail to satisfy physical constraints (such as conservation of matter) or rely on a priori assumptions that may not be valid. I present new, simple models of canonical Gram-negative and Gram-positive QS systems, in both well-mixed and biofilm populations, focusing on the interaction between molecular and population processes. I show that this interaction may be crucial for several important features of QS, including bistability and the localization of QS in space. The results highlight the need to link molecular and population processes carefully in QS models, provide a general framework for understanding the behavior of complex system-specific models, and suggest new directions for both theoretical and experimental work.},

Here we explore theoretically the potentials and limitations of combinatorial signal integration at the level of cis-regulatory transcription control. Our analysis suggests that many complex transcription-control functions of the type encountered in higher eukaryotes are already implementable within the much simpler bacterial transcription system. Using a quantitative model of bacterial transcription and invoking only specific protein-DNA interaction and weak glue-like interaction between regulatory proteins, we show explicit schemes to implement regulatory logic functions of increasing complexity by appropriately selecting the strengths and arranging the relative positions of the relevant protein-binding DNA sequences in the cis-regulatory region. The architectures that emerge are naturally modular and evolvable. Our results suggest that the transcription regulatory apparatus is a computing machine, belonging formally to the class of Boltzmann machines. Crucial to our results is the ability to regulate gene expression at a distance. In bacteria, this can be achieved for isolated genes via DNA looping controlled by the dimerization of DNA-bound proteins. However, if adopted extensively in the genome, long-distance interaction can cause unintentional intergenic cross talk, a detrimental side effect difficult to overcome by the known bacterial transcription-regulation systems. This may be a key factor limiting the genome-wide adoption of complex transcription control in bacteria. Implications of our findings for combinatorial transcription control in eukaryotes are discussed.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and the leading cause of mortality among immunocompromised patients in clinical setups. The hallmarks of virulence in P. aeruginosa encompass six biologically competent attributes that cumulatively drive disease progression in a multistep manner. These multifaceted hallmarks lay the principal foundation for rationalizing the complexities of pseudomonal infections. They include factors for host colonization and bacterial motility, biofilm formation, production of destructive enzymes, toxic secondary metabolites, iron-chelating siderophores and toxins. This arsenal of virulence hallmarks is fostered and stringently regulated by the bacterial signalling system called quorum sensing (QS). The central regulatory functions of QS in controlling the timely expression of these virulence hallmarks for adaptation and survival drive the disease outcome. This review describes the intricate mechanisms of QS in P. aeruginosa and its role in shaping bacterial responses, boosting bacterial fitness. We summarize the virulence hallmarks of P. aeruginosa, relating them with the QS circuitry in clinical infections. We also examine the role of QS in the development of drug resistance and propose a novel antivirulence therapy to combat P. aeruginosa infections. This can prove to be a next-generation therapy that may eventually become refractory to the use of conventional antimicrobial treatments.},

The recently completed P. aeruginosa genome-sequencing project revealed a gene coding for a homolog of the signal receptors, LasR and RhlR. Here we describe a role for this gene, which we call qscR. The qscR gene product governs the timing of quorum-sensing-controlled gene expression and it dampens virulence in an insect model. We present evidence that suggests the primary role of QscR is repression of lasI. A qscR mutant produces the LasI-generated signal prematurely, and this results in premature transcription of a number of quorum-sensing-regulated genes. When fed to Drosophila melanogaster, the qscR mutant kills the animals more rapidly than the parental P. aeruginosa. The repression of lasI by QscR could serve to ensure that quorum-sensing-controlled genes are not activated in environments where they are not useful.},

Although the intracellular regulatory mechanisms of QS are often well-understood, the functional roles of QS remain controversial. In particular, the use of multiple signals by many bacterial species poses a serious challenge to current functional theories. Here, we address this challenge by showing that bacteria can use multiple QS signals to infer both their social (density) and physical (mass-transfer) environment. Analytical and evolutionary simulation models show that the detection of, and response to, complex social/physical contrasts requires multiple signals with distinct half-lives and combinatorial (nonadditive) responses to signal concentrations. We test these predictions using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and demonstrate significant differences in signal decay between its two primary signal molecules, as well as diverse combinatorial responses to dual-signal inputs. QS is associated with the control of secreted factors, and we show that secretome genes are preferentially controlled by synergistic responses to multiple signal inputs, ensuring the effective expression of secreted factors in high-density and low mass-transfer environments. Our results support a new functional hypothesis for the use of multiple signals and, more generally, show that bacteria are capable of combinatorial communication.},

Here we examine the social evolution of QS experimentally in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and show that although QS can provide a benefit at the group level, exploitative individuals can avoid the cost of producing the QS signal or of performing the cooperative behaviour that is coordinated by QS, and can therefore spread. We also show that a solution to the problem of exploitation is kin selection, if interacting bacterial cells tend to be close relatives. These results show that the problem of exploitation, which has been the focus of considerable attention in animal communication, also arises in bacteria.},

Using the analytical tools of ultra performance liquid chromatography and high resolution MS, it was possible to determine not only the various AHLs synthesized over time but also their degradation products. 3-oxo-decanoyl-homoserine lactone was found to be the dominant AHL, which reached its maximum in the early logarithmic growth phase. Although the pH of the medium was neutral, the AHLs were degraded thereafter rapidly to the corresponding homoserines and other metabolites. The proposed lactonase gene of P. putida IsoF could not be identified, because it is apparently quite different from hitherto described lactonases. The analytical data were used to calculate the rates and thresholds of AHL production by mathematical modelling, allowing quantitative predictions and a further understanding of the QS-based regulations in this bacterium.

Studies performed with these mutant versions of LasR demonstrated that the ability of LasR to multimerize correlates with its ability to function as a transcriptional activator of lasI, a gene known to be tightly regulated by the LasR-3O-C(12)-HSL regulatory system. A LasR molecule that carries a C-terminal deletion can function as a dominant-negative mutant in P. aeruginosa, as shown by its ability to decrease expression of lasB, another LasR-3O-C(12)-HSL target gene.

Two quorum-sensing regulons have been identified in which the LuxR homologues LasR and RhlR are activated by N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL) respectively. The lasR and rhlR genes are linked to the luxl homologues lasl and rhll, which are responsible for synthesis of OdDHL and BHL, respectively. As lasRl and rhlRl are both involved in regulating synthesis of exoenzymes such as elastase, we sought to determine the nature of their interrelationship. By using lacZ transcriptional fusions in both homologous (P. aeruginosa) and heterologous (Escherichia coli) genetic backgrounds we provide evidence that (i) lasR is expressed constitutively throughout the growth cycle, (ii) rhlR expression is regulated by LasR/OdDHL, and (iii) that RhlR/BHL regulates rhll. We also show that expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor gene rpoS is abolished in a P. aeruginosa lasR mutant and in the pleiotropic BHL-negative mutant PANO67. Furthermore, our data reveal that kin E. coli, an rpoS-lacZ fusion is regulated directly by RhlR/BHL. Taken together, these results indicate that P. aeruginosa employs a multilayered hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving RhlR/BHL and LasR/OdDHL, interlinked via RpoS, to integrate the regulation of virulence determinants and secondary metabolites with adaptation and survival in the stationary phase.},

Furthermore, at physiological concentrations (10 nM), CSF was transported into the cell by the oligopeptide permease encoded by spo0K (opp).

Quorum sensing (QS), a cell density-based intercellular communication system, which plays a key role in regulation of the bacterial virulence and biofilm formation, could be a promising target for developing new strategies against P. aeruginosa infection. The QS network of P. aeruginosa is organized in a multi-layered hierarchy consisting of at least four interconnected signaling mechanisms. Evidence is accumulating that the QS regulatory network not only responds to bacterial population changes but also could react to environmental stress cues. This plasticity should be taken into consideration during exploration and development of anti-QS therapeutics.},

Using single-cell fluorescence microscopy, we quantified the signaling responses to and analyzed the integration of multiple autoinducers by the model quorum-sensing bacterium Vibrio harveyi. Our results revealed that signals from two distinct autoinducers, AI-1 and AI-2, are combined strictly additively in a shared phosphorelay pathway, with each autoinducer contributing nearly equally to the total response. We found a coherent response across the population with little cell-to-cell variation, indicating that the entire population of cells can reliably distinguish several distinct conditions of external autoinducer concentration. We speculate that the use of multiple autoinducers allows a growing population of cells to synchronize gene expression during a series of distinct developmental stages.},

A third P. aeruginosa signal, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone [Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS)], also plays a significant role in the transcription of multiple P. aeruginosa virulence genes. PQS is intertwined in the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing hierarchy with its production and bioactivity requiring the las and rhl quorum sensing systems, respectively. This report presents a preliminary transcriptional analysis of pqsA, the first gene of the recently discovered PQS biosynthetic gene cluster. We show that pqsA transcription required pqsR, a transcriptional activator protein encoded within the PQS biosynthetic gene cluster. It was also found that the transcription of pqsA and subsequent production of PQS was induced by the las quorum sensing system and repressed by the rhl quorum sensing system. In addition, PQS production was dependent on the ratio of 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL to C(4)-HSL, suggesting a regulatory balance between quorum sensing systems. These data are an important early step toward understanding the regulation of PQS synthesis and the role of PQS in P. aeruginosa intercellular signaling.},

Several previously unknown QS-regulated proteins were characterized, including an aminopeptidase (PA2939), an endoproteinase (PrpL) and a unique `hypothetical' protein (PA0572), which could not be detected in the culture supernatants of Deltalas mutants, although they were unaffected in Deltarhl mutants. Chitin-binding protein (CbpD) and a hypothetical protein (PA4944) with similarity to host factor I (HF-I) could not be detected when any of the lasRI or rhlRI genes were disrupted. Fourteen proteins were present at significantly greater levels in the culture supernatants of QS mutants, suggesting that QS may also negatively control the expression of some genes. Increased levels of two-partner secretion exoproteins (PA0041 and PA4625) were observed and may be linked to increased stability of their cognate transporters in a QS-defective background.

QS systems are tremendously diverse in terms of their specific sensory components, the biochemical and transport properties of signaling molecules, their target functions and the context in which QS-mediated functions are activated. Cutting across this diversity, however, the central architecture of QS systems is universal; it comprises signal synthesis, secretion, degradation and detection. We are thus able to derive a general metric for QS `sensing potential' based on this `core' module. The sensing potential quantifies the ability of a single bacterium to sense the dimensions of its microenvironment. This simple metric captures the dominant activation properties of diverse QS systems, giving a concise description of the sensing characteristics. As such, it provides a convenient quantitative framework to study the phenotypic effects of QS characteristics. As an example, we show how QS characteristics uniquely determine the scenarios in which regulation of a typical QS-controlled function, such as exoenzyme secretion, becomes advantageous.},

Induction of lasB (encoding elastase) and other virulence genes requires LasR and PAI-1. The rhl system consists of a putative transcriptional activator, RhlR, and RhlI, which directs the synthesis of N-butyryl homoserine lactone (PAI-2). Rhamnolipid production in P. aeruginosa has been reported to require both the rhl system and rhlAB (encoding a rhamnosyltransferase). Here we report the generation of a delta lasI mutant and both delta lasI delta rhlI and delta lasR rhlR::Tn501 double mutants of strain PAO1. Rhamnolipid production and elastolysis were reduced in the delta lasI single mutant and abolished in the double-mutant strains. rhlAB mRNA was not detected in these strains at mid-logarithmic phase but was abundant in the parental strain. Further RNA analysis of the wild-type strain revealed that rhlAB is organized as an operon. The rhlAB transcriptional start was mapped, and putative sigma 54 and sigma 70 promoters were identified upstream. To define components required for rhlAB expression, we developed a bioassay in Escherichia coli and demonstrated that PAI-2 and RhlR are required and sufficient for expression of rhlA. To characterize the putative interaction between PAI-2 and RhlR, we demonstrated that [3H]PAI-2 binds to E. coli cells expressing RhlR and not to those expressing LasR. Finally, the specificity of the las and rhl systems was examined in E. coli bioassays. The las system was capable of mildly activating rhlA, and similarly, the rhl system partly activated lasB. However; these effects were much less than the activation of rhlA by the rhl system and lasB by the las system. The results presented here further characterize the roles of the rhl and las quorum-sensing systems in virulence gene expression.},

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cell-to-cell signaling controls expression of extracellular virulence factors, the type II secretion apparatus, a stationary-phase sigma factor (sigmas), and biofilm differentiation. The fact that a similar signal, N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone, freely diffuses through Vibrio fischeri and Escherichia coli cells has led to the assumption that all AIs are freely diffusible. In this work, transport of the two P. aeruginosa AIs, N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) (formerly called PAI-1) and N-butyryl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) (formerly called PAI-2), was studied by using tritium-labeled signals. When [3H]C4-HSL was added to cell suspensions of P. aeruginosa, the cellular concentration reached a steady state in less than 30 s and was nearly equal to the external concentration, as expected for a freely diffusible compound. In contrast, [3H]3OC12-HSL required about 5 min to reach a steady state, and the cellular concentration was 3 times higher than the external level. Addition of inhibitors of the cytoplasmic membrane proton gradient, such as azide, led to a strong increase in cellular accumulation of [3H]3OC12-HSL, suggesting the involvement of active efflux. A defined mutant lacking the mexA-mexB-oprM-encoded active-efflux pump accumulated [3H]3OC12-HSL to levels similar to those in the azide-treated wild-type cells. Efflux experiments confirmed these observations. Our results show that in contrast to the case for C4-HSL, P. aeruginosa cells are not freely permeable to 3OC12-HSL. Instead, the mexA-mexB-oprM-encoded efflux pump is involved in active efflux of 3OC12-HSL. Apparently the length and/or degree of substitution of the N-acyl side chain determines whether an AI is freely diffusible or is subject to active efflux by P. aeruginosa.},

The chapter is divided into two sections: ordinary differential equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE) models of QS. Rates of change are represented mathematically by derivatives, i.e., in terms of DE. ODE models allow describing changes in one independent variable, for example, time. PDE models can be used to follow changes in more than one independent variable, for example, time and space. Both types of models often consist of systems (i.e., more than one equation) of equations, such as equations for bacterial growth and autoinducer concentration dynamics.

volume = {5}, 
pages = {153}, 
year = {2011}, 
abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the puzzles in bacterial quorum sensing is understanding how an organism integrates the information gained from multiple input signals. The marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri regulates its bioluminescence through a quorum sensing mechanism that receives input from three pheromone signals, including two acyl homoserine lactone (HSL) signals. While the role of the 3-oxo-C6 homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL) signal in activating the lux genes has been extensively studied and modeled, the role of the C8 homoserine lactone (C8HSL) is less obvious, as it can either activate luminescence or block its activation. It remains unclear how crosstalk between C8HSL and 3OC6HSL affects the information that the bacterium obtains through quorum sensing. RESULTS: We have used microfluidic methods to measure the response of individual V.fischeri cells to combinations of C8HSL and 3OC6HSL. By measuring the fluorescence of individual V.fischeri cells containing a chromosomal gfp-reporter for the lux genes, we study how combinations of exogenous HSLs affect both the population average and the cell-to-cell variability of lux activation levels. At the level of a population average, the crosstalk between the C8HSL and 3OC6HSL inputs is well-described by a competitive inhibition model. At the level of individual cells, the heterogeneity in the lux response depends only on the average degree of activation, so that the noise in the output is not reduced by the presence of the second HSL signal. Overall we find that the mutual information between the signal inputs and the lux output is less than one bit. A nonlinear correlation between fluorescence and bioluminescence outputs from lux leads to different noise properties for these reporters. CONCLUSIONS: The lux genes in V.fischeri do not appear to distinguish between the two HSL inputs, and even with two signal inputs the regulation of lux is extremely noisy. Hence the role of crosstalk from the C8HSL input may not be to improve sensing precision, but rather to suppress the sensitivity of the switch for as long as possible during colony growth.},

In Gram-negative bacteria, quorum sensing systems function through a cell-to-cell signal molecule (autoinducer) that consists of a homoserine lactone with a fatty acid side chain. Such is the case in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which contains two quorum sensing systems (las and rhl) that operate via the autoinducers, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone and N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone. The study of these signal molecules has shown that they bind to and activate transcriptional activator proteins that specifically induce numerous P. aeruginosa virulence genes. We report here that P. aeruginosa produces another signal molecule, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone, which has been designated as the Pseudomonas quinolone signal. It was found that this unique cell-to-cell signal controlled the expression of lasB, which encodes for the major virulence factor, LasB elastase. We also show that the synthesis and bioactivity of Pseudomonas quinolone signal were mediated by the P. aeruginosa las and rhl quorum sensing systems, respectively. The demonstration that 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone can function as an intercellular signal sheds light on the role of secondary metabolites and shows that P. aeruginosa cell-to-cell signaling is not restricted to acyl-homoserine lactones.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-cell communication that connects gene expression to environmental conditions (e.g., cell density) in many bacterial species, mediated by diffusible signal molecules. Current functional studies focus on qualitatively distinct QS ON/OFF states. In the context of density sensing, this view led to the adoption of a analogy in which populations sense when they are above a sufficient density (i.e.) to efficiently turn on cooperative behaviors. This framework overlooks the potential for intermediate, graded responses to shifts in the environment. In this study, we tracked QS-regulated protease (lasB) expression and showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can deliver a graded behavioral response to fine-scale variation in population density, on both the population and single-cell scales. On the population scale, we saw a graded response to variation in population density (controlled by culture carrying capacity). On the single-cell scale, we saw significant bimodality at higher densities, with separate OFF and ON subpopulations that responded differentially to changes in density: a static OFF population of cells and increasing intensity of expression among the ON population of cells. Together, these results indicate that QS can tune gene expression to graded environmental change, with no critical cell mass or at which behavioral responses are activated on either the individual-cell or population scale. In an infection context, our results indicate there is not a hard threshold separating a quorate mode from a subquorate mode. IMPORTANCE Bacteria can be highly social, controlling collective behaviors via cell-cell communication mechanisms known as quorum sensing (QS). QS is now a large research field, yet a basic question remains unanswered: what is the environmental resolution of QS? The notion of a threshold, or separating coordinated ON and OFF states is a central dogma in QS, but recent studies have shown heterogeneous responses at a single cell scale. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we showed that populations generate graded responses to environmental variation through shifts in the proportion of cells responding and the intensity of responses.

abstract = {Coordinate activation of transcription by multiple enhancer binding factors is essential for the regulation of pattern formation during development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cell-free transcription reactions are described that recapitulate transcriptional synergism directed by the Drosophila developmental regulators Bicoid (BCD) and Hunchback (HB). Within the basal transcription factor complex TFIID, two specific targets, TAFII110 and TAFII60, served as coactivators to mediate transcriptional activation by these two enhancer binding proteins. A quadruple complex containing TATA binding protein (TBP), TAFII250, TAFII110, and TAFII60 mediated transcriptional synergism by BCD and HB, whereas triple TBP-TAFII complexes lacking one or the other target coactivator failed to support synergistic activation. Deoxyribonuclease I footprint protection experiments revealed that an integral step leading to transcriptional synergism involves the recruitment of TBP-TAFII complexes to the promoter by way of multivalent contacts between activators and selected TAFIIs. Thus, the concerted action of multiple regulators with different coactivators helps to establish the pattern and level of segmentation gene transcription during Drosophila development.}, }

volume = {8}, 
pages = {287}, 
year = {2007}, 
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quorum-sensing regulation of gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is complex. Two interconnected acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) signal-receptor pairs, 3-oxo-dodecanoyl-HSL-LasR and butanoyl-HSL-RhlR, regulate more than 300 genes. The induction of most of the genes is delayed during growth of P. aeruginosa in complex medium, cannot be advanced by addition of exogenous signal, and requires additional regulatory components. Many of these late genes can be induced by addition of signals early by using specific media conditions. While several factors super-regulate the quorum receptors, others may co-regulate target promoters or may affect expression posttranscriptionally. RESULTS: To better understand the contributions of super-regulation and co-regulation to quorum-sensing gene expression, and to better understand the general structure of the quorum sensing network, we ectopically expressed the two receptors (in the presence of their cognate signals) and another component that affects quorum sensing, the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS, early in growth. We determined the effect on target gene expression by microarray and real-time PCR analysis. Our results show that many target genes (e.g. lasB and hcnABC) are directly responsive to receptor protein levels. Most genes (e.g. lasA, lecA, and phnAB), however, are not significantly affected, although at least some of these genes are directly regulated by quorum sensing. The majority of promoters advanced by RhlR appeared to be regulated directly, which allowed us to build a RhlR consensus sequence. CONCLUSION: The direct responsiveness of many quorum sensing target genes to receptor protein levels early in growth confirms the role of super-regulation in quorum sensing gene expression. The observation that the induction of most target genes is not affected by signal or receptor protein levels indicates that either target promoters are co-regulated by other transcription factors, or that expression is controlled posttranscriptionally. This architecture permits the integration of multiple signaling pathways resulting in quorum responses that require a but are otherwise highly adaptable and receptive to environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Cooperative behaviors provide a collective benefit, but are considered costly for the individual. Here, we report that these costs vary dramatically in different contexts and have opposing effects on the selection for non-cooperating cheaters. We investigate a prominent example of bacterial cooperation, the secretion of the peptide siderophore pyoverdine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, under different nutrient-limiting conditions. Using metabolic modeling, we show that pyoverdine incurs a fitness cost only when its building blocks carbon or nitrogen are growth-limiting and are diverted from cellular biomass production. We confirm this result experimentally with a continuous-culture approach. We show that pyoverdine non-producers (cheaters) enjoy a large fitness advantage in co-culture with producers (cooperators) and spread to high frequency when limited by carbon, but not when limited by phosphorus. The principle of nutrient-dependent fitness costs has implications for the stability of cooperation in pathogenic and non-pathogenic environments, in biotechnological applications, and beyond the microbial realm.Cooperative behaviour among individuals provides a collective benefit, but is considered costly. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model system, the authors show that secretion of the siderophore pyoverdine only incurs a fitness cost and favours cheating when its building blocks carbon or nitrogen are growth-limiting.},

abstract = {Quorum sensing (QS) is a process by which individual bacteria are able to communicate with one another, thereby enabling the population as a whole to coordinate gene regulation and subsequent phenotypic outcomes. Communication is accomplished through production and detection of small molecules in the extracellular milieu. In many bacteria, particularly Vibrio species, multiple QS systems result in multiple signals, as well as cross talk between systems. In this study, we identify two QS systems in the halophilic enteric pathogen Vibrio fluvialis: one acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) based and one CAI-1/AI-2 based. We show that a LuxI homolog, VfqI, primarily produces 3-oxo-C10-HSL, which is sensed by a LuxR homolog, VfqR. VfqR-AHL is required to activate vfqI expression and autorepress vfqR expression. In addition, we have shown that similar to that in V. cholerae and V. harveyi, V. fluvialis produces CAI-1 and AI-2 signal molecules to activate the expression of a V. cholerae HapR homolog through LuxO. Although VfqR-AHL does not regulate hapR expression, HapR can repress vfqR transcription. Furthermore, we found that QS in V. fluvialis positively regulates production of two potential virulence factors, an extracellular protease and hemolysin. QS also affects cytotoxic activity against epithelial tissue cultures. These data suggest that V. fluvialis integrates QS regulatory pathways to play important physiological roles in pathogenesis.},

abstract = {The regulation of density-dependent behaviour by means of quorum sensing is widespread in bacteria, the relevant phenomena including bioluminescence and population expansion by swarming, as well as virulence. The process of quorum sensing is regulated by the production and monitoring of certain molecules (referred to as QSMs); on reaching an apparent threshold concentration of QSMs (reflecting high bacterial density) the bacterial colony in concert `switches on' the density-dependent trait. In this paper a mathematical model which describes bacterial population growth and quorum sensing in a well mixed system is proposed and studied. We view the population of bacteria as consisting of down-regulated and up-regulated sub-populations, with QSMs being produced at a much faster rate by the up-regulated cells. Using curve fitting techniques for parameter estimation, solutions of the resulting system of ordinary differential equations are shown to agree well with experimental data. Asymptotic analysis in a biologically relevant limit is used to investigate the timescales for up-regulation of an exponentially growing population of bacteria, revealing the existence of bifurcation between limited and near-total up-regulation. For a fixed population of cells steady-state analysis reveals that in general one physical steady-state solution exists and is linearly stable; we believe this solution to be a global attractor. A bifurcation between limited and near-total up-regulation is also discussed in the steady-state limit.},

A heterologous model has been generated for the study of the LasRI/3OC12HSL regulatory network in Escherichia coli. Escherichia coli pAHL-BAC cultures produced LasI-synthesized acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) at levels and with kinetics similar to what is observed in cultures of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. Analysis of the lasI transcript also showed similar induction profiles in both the E. coli pAHL-BAC strain and P. aeruginosa. Transposon mutagenesis of pAHL-BAC confirmed that transcriptional regulation by LasR is necessary for 3OC12HSL production, and showed that artificially increasing lasI transcript levels leads to higher levels of 3OC12HSL. Previous studies have shown that P. aeruginosa 3OC12HSL inhibits hypha formation, but not growth, in Candida albicans, and the E. coli pAHL-BAC similarly inhibited filamentation when grown in coculture with the fungus. It is proposed that this system will be useful for the study of factors that impact lasI regulation and 3OC12HSL production, and for the examination of the role of LasI-produced AHLs in bacterial interactions with other organisms.},

abstract = {Bacteria communicate with one another using chemical signal molecules. As in higher organisms, the information supplied by these molecules is critical for synchronizing the activities of large groups of cells. In bacteria, chemical communication involves producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to small hormone-like molecules termed autoinducers. This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacteria to monitor the environment for other bacteria and to alter behavior on a population-wide scale in response to changes in the number and/or species present in a community. Most quorum-sensing-controlled processes are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium acting alone but become beneficial when carried out simultaneously by a large number of cells. Thus, quorum sensing confuses the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes because it enables bacteria to act as multicellular organisms. This review focuses on the architectures of bacterial chemical communication networks; how chemical information is integrated, processed, and transduced to control gene expression; how intra- and interspecies cell-cell communication is accomplished; and the intriguing possibility of prokaryote-eukaryote cross-communication.},

We have constructed a library of random insertions in the chromosome of a P. aeruginosa acyl-HSL synthesis mutant by using a transposon containing a promoterless lacZ. This library was screened for acyl-HSL induction of lacZ. Thirty-nine quorum sensing-regulated genes were identified. The genes were organized into classes depending on the pattern of regulation. About half of the genes appear to be in seven operons, some seem organized in large patches on the genome. Many of the quorum sensing-regulated genes code for putative virulence factors or production of secondary metabolites.

abstract = {Bacteria use quorum sensing to monitor cell density and coordinate group behaviours. In Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, quorum sensing is connected to virulence gene expression via the two autoinducer molecules, AI-2 and CAI-1. Both autoinducers share one signal transduction pathway to control the production of AphA, a key transcriptional activator of biofilm formation and virulence genes. In this study, we demonstrate that the recently identified autoinducer, DPO, also controls AphA production in V. cholerae. DPO, functioning through the transcription factor VqmA and the VqmR small RNA, reduces AphA levels at the post-transcriptional level and consequently inhibits virulence gene expression. VqmR-mediated repression of AphA provides an important link between the AI-2/CAI-1 and DPO-dependent quorum sensing pathways in V. cholerae. Transcriptome analyses comparing the effect of single autoinducers versus autoinducer combinations show that quorum sensing controls the expression of ∼400 genes in V. cholerae and that all three autoinducers are required for a full quorum sensing response. Together, our data provide a global view on autoinducer interplay in V. cholerae and highlight the importance of RNA-based gene control for collective functions in this major human pathogen.},
